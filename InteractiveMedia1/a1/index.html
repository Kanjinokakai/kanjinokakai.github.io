    <h1>Interactive Website</h1>

    <ol>

    <ul>
      <h4>1. What was the first thing you paid attention to when interacting with the experience?</h4>
      <li>The simplicity of the website caught my attention when first interacting with the page. Instead of flashy visuals and graphics,
      <br>it has a clean interface and uncluttered layout, which can be identified by the use of simple colour scheme, which resulted in
      <br>easy navigation due to the unessary distractions on the page. </li>
      
    </ul>

    <ul>
      <h4>2. Spend two minutes with the experience and create a list of each of your discrete actions.</h4>
      <li>Portfolio - Social Diary (an app where people can share their sotries and edit them) - Project Link (github page)
      <li>About & Skills (A brief introduction of the creator and his IT skills and knowledges)
      <li>Profile - Twitter</li>
    </ul>

    <ul>
      <h4>3. What part of the experience did you spend the most time engaging with?</h4>
      <li>I have spent most of my time on exploring the creator's self introduction and the various skills he listed, and noticed how 
      <br>he is passionate to try and learn new technologies, such as the four different programming languages that he displayed.</li>
    </ul>

    <ul>
      <h4>4. What was the most common action in your two minute interaction with the experience?</h4>
      <li>The most common action I had was exploring his portfolio site and checked all his previous works. For example, I viewed the
      <br> front page of his his online Bike Shop company, which he built by using skills like html and css. 
      </li>
    </ul>

    <ul>
      <h4>5. What is your impression of the intended primary goal of the interactive experience?</h4>
      <li>The intended primary goal of this experience should be informative and straight to the point, which I believe the site has 
      <br>achieved its target. There are a total of three options on the home page, which are Portfolio, About & Skills, and Profiles. 
      <br>Each of these options are clearly labled, with several specified branches connected to each of them and assist the viewers 
      <br>for locating the sites and sources that they want to explore.
     </li>
    </ul>

    <ul>
      <h4>6. What is your impression of how the interactive experience communicates its primary goal?</h4>
      <li>My overall impression is positive through out the experience. For each of the mini braches, the creator has specifictly 
      <br>outlined the links, urls, technologies involved in the project, and the unique feactures that he has included.</li>
    </ul>

    <ul>
      <h4>7. What is your impression of how the experience should be interacted with over time? (For how long and how many different times)</h4>
      <li>From my own point of view, the viewers should at least continuesly receiving new information on an ongoing basis. 
      <br>The satisfactory time for understading the basic funcation of a website should be no longer than five minutes, or else it 
      <br>might cause frustrating for the viewers and thus, can be considered as user-unfriendly interface. 
      </li>
    </ul>

    <ul>
      <h4>8. What is your impression of how the interactive experience communicates how it should be interacted with over time?</h4>
      <li>The exploration of the site is like a treasure hunt. On the surface, the site looks simple and lack in interactive elements, 
      <br>but as the time passes by, you start to discover the extensive multimedia content and numerous categories of information.</li>
    </ul>

    <ul>
      <h4>9. What other media forms (digital or otherwise) does the experience reference?</h4>
      <li>Although the creator has not specify which website he has referenced from, there are other similar designs that can be looked 
      <br>into. For example, AlmostReal (https://almostreal.me/) is an online shop for art photography from a collective of creatives,
      <br>its interface also has a simplistic style for easy navigation.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <ul>
      <h4>10. What does this reference or references suggest to you about how you should act when engaging with it?</h4>
      <li>By observing the overall layout of the pages, I think the creator for AlmostReal is attempting to persuade the viewers to
      <br>either scroll down the page and view the various art pieces in different categories, or check out the options on the top 
      <br>left corner, and discover a list of artists and the fields they are expert in.</li>
    </ul>

    <ul>
      <h4>11. What does this reference or references suggest to you about how you should feel when engaging with it?</h4>
      <li>Although I cannot judge the intention, I think this reference is trying to treat me like a buyer who is interested in 
      <br>exploring arts in different styles and forms, including the niche and often unoticed ones. This is because the site has a 
      <br>list of categories of the artists who specialises in making a certain unique style in art.   </li>
    </ul>

    <ul>
      <h4>12. What is the most frustrating element of the interaction to you and what makes it frustrating?</h4>
      <li>The most frustrating element might the creator's choice of colour. The use of pure white is dazzingly bright and may cause 
      <br>uncomfortable user experience. 
      </li>
    </ul>

    <ul>
      <h4>13. What is the most satisfying element of the interaction to you and what makes it satisfying?</h4>
      <li>The most satisfying element might be the navigation system that the creator has built. It was easy to find the specific 
      <br>site that contains the information the viewers need, due to its clear labeling and interface. 
          
      </li>
    </ul>
