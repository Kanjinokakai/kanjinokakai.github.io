      <section> 
        <p> 
          In the realm of web design, creating an immersive experience for users is a powerful tool to engage and captivate their attention. 
        For this assignment, I have included multiple unique html and css elements to enhance the overall experience of my website, 
        which focuses on the parallax effect, audio option, and back-to-top bottom. 
        </p>

        <p>
          Colour is a crucial element when making a parallax effect. 
          I decided to incorporate two images depicting a daytime city and a nighttime city, as it allows users to experience the significant contrast between day and night. 
          The daytime city image has warm tones that create a lively and energetic atmosphere. 
          It conveys a sense of optimism and represents the bustling activities of a vibrant metropolis during the day. 
          As users scroll down, the transition to the night-time city image introduces cooler tones, emphasizing quietness. 
          This represents the transformation from a bustling city to a quieter, mysterious environment.
          The transition between the daytime and nighttime city images is fluid, which heightens the viewersâ€™ engagement and interest.
        </p>

        <p>
          Two audios are also added to build the atmosphere for the two images. 
          When viewers explore the daytime city image, the busy street sounds accompany the visuals, enhancing the immersive experience. 
          This includes people having conversations, cars passing by, sirens, and other urban sounds. 
          This combination allows users to feel as though they are present in a lively city, making their engagement with the website more memorable.
        </p>

        <p>
          As for the nighttime city, I added audio sounds of rain and cars, emphasizing a sense of danger. 
          The sound of rain in the night city soundscape creates a gloomy mood, adding depth to the scene.
        </p>

        <p>
          Viewers can also notice how I purposely made the two audios controllable. 
          This is because not all viewers may want to listen to the audio. 
          Despite the fact that audio can increase the immersive experience, it can also be distracting for some users, 
          particularly when they are trying to focus on playing around with the webpage. 
          By providing control over the audio, viewers can manage their attention and avoid potential distractions, 
          allowing them to concentrate on the interactions.
        </p>

        <p>
          A back-to-top bottom has also been included in the webpage to improve the user experience. 
          The webpage is relatively long with two images and 500 words of content. 
          Without the option of navigating back to the top of the page can be time-consuming and frustrating, especially on mobile devices. 
          With the increasing popularity of mobile browsing, it is essential to optimize the user experience for mobile devices,
          making a smoother and more efficient browsing experience. 
          The presence of a "Back to Top" button allows viewers to return to the top quickly and effortlessly with just one click. 
          It simplifies navigation and enhances the overall user experience by saving time and effort. 
        </p>

        <p>
          When I was planning for the webpage, I once considered thought about making the text slowly change colour when hovering above. 
          However, I changed my mind during the process, as it might be an unnecessary distraction, 
          resulting in a negative user experience for the viewers.
        </p>
  
        <p>
          The webpage has delivered an interactive experience,
          by visually dynamic colour changes between day and night time city,
          while the additional background sounds increased the atmosphere and realism. 
          The webpage also includes a back to top bottom, which can be convenient for the viewers,
          leaving a lasting impression on them.
        </p>
